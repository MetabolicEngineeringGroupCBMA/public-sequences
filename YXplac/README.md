The **Yxplac series of vectors** are classical *Saccharomyces cerevisiae* expression plasmids engineered to provide strong, regulatable transcription driven by the **GAL1**, **GAL10**, or **GAL7** promoters. Built as shuttle vectors, they replicate in both *E. coli* and yeast, allowing easy cloning and high-level galactose-induced expression in vivo. Their modular design (including choices of selectable markers and promoter variants) made them foundational tools in early yeast molecular genetics and remain useful in studies requiring tightly controlled overexpression of heterologous or native yeast genes. These vectors were originally described by Guarente and colleagues in 1983.
